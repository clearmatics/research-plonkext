\section{\COMMENT{Forking s}Simulation-extractability---the general result}
\label{sec:general}
Equipped with definitional framework of \cref{sec:se_definitions}, we now present the main result of this paper---a proof of
\COMMENT{forking }simulation extractability of Fiat-Shamir compiled multi-round protocols.

The proof proceeds by game hopping. The games are controlled by an environment $\env$
that internally runs a simulation extractability adversary $\advse$, provides it
with access to a random oracle and simulator, and when necessary, rewinds it. The
games differ by various breaking points, i.e.~points where the environment
decides to abort the game.

The first game $\game{0}$ is a simulation-extractability game, where the extractor
gets as input
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item simulated proofs $Q$,
\item random oracle queries $Q_\ro$,
\item SRS updates $Q_\srs$
\end{inparaenum}
which were made by $\advse$.  We denote by $\radv$ randomness of $\advse$ and by
$\rsim$ randomness that was used by the simulator to create responses in the list
$Q$, formally one can state that $\rsim$ could be parsed into $r_Q$ and $r_\ro$ used
to answer queries in $Q$ and $Q_\ro$. Let $r = (\radv, \rsim)$. Randomness $r$ is
used in the following games -- we pass it to a unique-response property reduction $\rdvur$
and forking special soundness adversary $\bdv$. Importantly, since we require that
$\rdvur$ and $\bdv$ are successful (with non-negligible probability) given uniformly
random randomness and $r$ is picked uniformly random we conclude that we do not
change any success probability by running $\rdvur$ and $\bdv$ on $r$. 

Denote by $\zkproof_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\simulator}$ proofs returned by the
adversary and the simulator respectively. We use $\zkproof[i]$ to denote
prover's message in the $i$-th round of the proof (counting from 1),
i.e.~$(2i - 1)$-th message exchanged in the protocol. $\zkproof[i].\ch$ denotes
the challenge that is given to the prover after $\zkproof[i]$, and
$\zkproof[i..j]$ to denote all messages of the proof including challenges
between rounds $i$ and $j$, but not challenge $\zkproof[j].\ch$. When it is not
explicitly stated, we denote the proven instance $\inp$ by $\zkproof[0]$
(however, there is no following challenge $\zkproof[0].\ch$).

Without loss of generality, we assume that whenever the accepting proof contains
a response to a challenge from a random oracle, then the adversary queried the
oracle to get it. It is straightforward to transform any adversary that violates
this condition into an adversary that makes these additional queries to the
random oracle and wins with the same probability.


\begin{theorem}[Simulation-extractable multi-message protocols]
  \label{thm:se}
  Let $\ps = (\kgen, \prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ be an interactive
  $(2 \mu + 1)$-message zero-knowledge proof system for $\RELGEN(\secparam)$. Let
  $\ro\colon \bin^{*} \to \bin^{\secpar}$ be a random oracle. If $\psfs$ has the
  $k$-\emph{unique response property} with security loss $\epsur(\secpar)$, is
  \emph{$k'$-programmable trapdoor-less simulatable}, is $(k'', n)$-\emph{forking
    special sound} with security loss $\epss(\secpar)$, and $k \geq k' \geq k''$ then
  $\psfs$ is \emph{simulation-extractable} with extraction error $\epsur(\secpar)$
  against $\ppt$ adversaries that makes up to $q$ random oracle queries and returns
  an acceptable proof with probability at least $\accProb$.  The extraction
  probability $\extProb$ is at least
  \( \extProb \geq \frac{1}{q^{n - 1}} (\accProb - \epsur(\secpar))^{n}
  -\eps(\secpar)\,, \) for some negligible $\eps(\secpar)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}		

  \ngame{0} This is the simulation-extractability game played between an adversary
  $\advse$ who is given access to an oracle $\initU$ that defines an updatable SRS
  setup, a random oracle $\ro$ and a simulation oracle $\simO$. We denote by $\rsim$
  randomness of $\simO$ which is randomly sampled. There is an extractor $\ext$ that,
  from a proof $\zkproof_{\advse}$ for instance $\inp_{\advse}$ output by the
  adversary and from transcripts of $\advse$'s operations -- which compounds of lists
  of
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item simulated proofs $Q$,
  \item random oracle queries $Q_\ro$,
  \item SRS updates $Q_\srs$.
  \end{inparaenum}
  -- is tasked to extract a witness $\wit_{\advse}$ such that
  $\REL(\inp_{\advse}, \wit_{\advse})$ holds. $\advse$ wins if it manages to produce
  an acceptable proof and the extractor fails to output a witness. In the following
  game hops we upper-bound the probability that this happens. Note that $\srs$ is
  with respect to the finalised SRS with respect to which $\adv$ is allowed to make
  simulation queries.

  \ngame{1} This is identical to $\game{0}$ except that now the game is aborted if
  there is $(\inp_\advse, \zkproof_{\simulator}) \in Q$ such that
  $\zkproof_\simulator[1..k] = \zkproof_{\advse}[1..k]$. That is, the adversary in
  its final proof reuses at least $k$ messages from a simulated proof, and the proof
  is accepting.  Denote this event by $\event{\errur}$.

  \ncase{Game 0 to Game 1} \michals{7.10}{I think we can make this reduction work
    even for a standard $k$-ur, not only the updatable one.} \michals{8.10}{If we
    know how to move proofs between SRSs} We have,
  \( \prob{\game{0} \land \nevent{\errur}} = \prob{\game{1} \land \nevent{\errur}} \)
  and, from the difference lemma, cf.~\cref{lem:difference_lemma},
  $ \abs{\prob{\game{0}} - \prob{\game{1}}} \leq \prob{\event{\errur}}\,$.  Thus, to
  show that the transition from one game to another introduces only minor change in
  probability of $\adv$ winning it should be shown that $\prob{\event{\errur}}$ is
  small.
  
  We can assume that $\adv$ queried the simulator on the instance it wishes to
  output, i.e.~$\inp_{\adv}$. We show a reduction $\rdvur$ that utilises $\adv$ to
  break the $\ur{k}$ property of $\ps$.That is, for randomness $r = (r_\adv, \rsim)$,
  $\rdvur (r)$ runs $\advse(r_\adv)$ internally as a black-box:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item The reduction answers $\adv$ update queries by asking the same query from the
    update oracle in the unique response experiment. The reduction finalises the same
    SRS $\srs$ as the one $\adv$ does.
  \item The reduction answers both queries to the simulator $\psfs.\simulator$
      and to the random oracle using $\rsim$. It also keeps lists $Q$, for the simulated proofs,
      and $Q_\ro$ for the random oracle queries.
  \item When $\adv$ makes a fake proof $\zkproof_{\adv}$ for $\inp_{\adv}$, $\rdvur$
    looks through lists $Q$ and $Q_\ro$ until it finds $\zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$
    such that $\zkproof_{\adv}[0..k] = \zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$ and a random
    oracle query $\zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch$ on $\zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$.
  \item $\rdvur$ returns two proofs for $\inp_{\adv}$:
  	\begin{align*}
      \zkproof_1 = (\zkproof_{\simulator}[1..k],
      \zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch, \zkproof_{\simulator}[k + 1..\mu + 1])\\
      \zkproof_2 = (\zkproof_{\simulator}[1..k],
      \zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch, \zkproof_{\adv}[k + 1..\mu + 1])
  	\end{align*}
  \end{compactitem}
  If $\zkproof_1 = \zkproof_2$, then $\adv$ fails to break simulation soundness, as
  $\zkproof_2 \in Q$. On the other hand, if the proofs are not equal, then $\rdvur$
  breaks $\ur{k}$-ness of $\ps$. This happens only with negligible probability
  $\epsur(\secpar)$, hence \( \prob{\event{\errur}} \leq \epsur(\secpar)\,. \)

  \COMMENT{We have,
    \( \prob{\game{0} \land \nevent{\errur}} = \prob{\game{1} \land
      \nevent{\errur}} \) and, from the difference lemma,
    cf.~\cref{lem:difference_lemma},
  \[ \abs{\prob{\game{0}} - \prob{\game{1}}} \leq \prob{\event{\errur}}\,. \]
  Thus, to show that the transition from one game to another introduces only
  minor change in probability of $\advse$ winning it should be shown that
  $\prob{\event{\errur}}$ is small.

  We can assume that $\advse$ queried the simulator on the instance it wishes to
  output---$\inp_{\advse}$. We show a reduction $\rdvur$ that utilises $\advse$,
  who outputs a valid proof for $\inp_{\advse}$, to break the $\ur{k}$ property of
  $\ps$. Let $\rdvur$ run $\advse$ internally as a black-box:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The reduction answers both queries to the simulator $\psfs.\simulator$ and to the random oracle. 
	It also keeps lists $Q$, for the simulated proofs, and $Q_\ro$ for the random oracle queries. 
\item When $\advse$ makes a fake proof $\zkproof_{\advse}$ for $\inp_{\advse}$,
  $\rdvur$ looks through lists $Q$ and $Q_\ro$ until it finds
  $\zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$ such that
  $\zkproof_{\advse}[0..k] = \zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$
  and a random oracle query $\zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch$ on
  $\zkproof_{\simulator}[0..k]$.
	\item $\rdvur$ returns two proofs for $\inp_{\advse}$:
	\begin{align*}
		\zkproof_1 = (\zkproof_{\simulator}[1..k],
		\zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch, \zkproof_{\simulator}[k + 1..\mu + 1])\\
		\zkproof_2 = (\zkproof_{\simulator}[1..k],
		\zkproof_{\simulator}[k].\ch, \zkproof_{\advse}[k + 1..\mu + 1])
	\end{align*}
	\end{itemize}  
	If $\zkproof_1 = \zkproof_2$, then $\advse$ fails to break simulation
  extractability, as $\zkproof_2 \in Q$. On the other hand, if the proofs are
  not equal, then $\rdvur$ breaks $\ur{k}$-ness of $\ps$. This happens only with
  negligible probability $\epsur(\secpar)$, hence \( \prob{\event{\errur}} \leq
  \epsur(\secpar)\,. \)

\ngame{2} Define an adversary $\bdv$ against forking special soundness such that,
given access to oracles $\initU$ and $\ro$, and randomness $r = (r_\adv, \rsim)$, it
internally runs $\advse^{\initU, \simO} (1^\secpar; r_\adv)$, where
\begin{compactenum}
\item $\bdv$ answers $\adv$ random oracle and update queries by passing the queries to the real
  oracles $\ro$ and $\initU$. When $\adv$ finalises an SRS $\srs$, $\bdv$ does the same.
\item $\bdv$ answers simulator queries by using coins $\rsim$. $\bdv$ maintains a
  list of instance-proof pairs $Q$ consisting of of all simulation queries made by
  $\adv$, and corresponding responses.
\item Eventually when $\adv$ outputs $(\inp_\advse, \zkproof_\advse)$, $\bdv$ outputs
  the same $(\inp_\advse, \zkproof_\advse)$.
\end{compactenum}
\michals{7.10}{Need forking soundness in the updatable setting. Alternatively we
  could show that we can move a proof from one SRS to another using partial trapdoor}

In this game the environment additionally aborts if extractor $\ext$ fails to build a
$(1, \ldots, 1, n, 1, \ldots, 1)$-tree of accepting transcripts $\tree$ by rewinding
$\bdv$.

$\ext$ proceeds as follows. First, it takes as input relation $\REL$, SRS $\srs$,
$\bdv$'s code, its randomness $r$, the output instance $\inp_{\advse}$ and proof
$\zkproof_{\advse}$, and the list of random oracle queries and responses
$Q_\ro$. Then, $\ext$ starts a forking algorithm
$\genforking^{n}_\zdv(y,h_1, \ldots, h_q)$ for
$y = (\srs, \bdv, r, \inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse})$ where we set
$h_1, \ldots, h_q$ to be the consecutive queries from list $Q_\ro$. We run $\bdv$
internally in $\zdv$.
		
To assure that in the first execution of $\zdv$ the adversary $\bdv$ produces the
same $(\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse})$ as in the extraction game, $\zdv$ provides
$\bdv$ with the same randomness $r$ and answers queries to the random oracle with
pre-recorded responses in $Q_\ro$.
		%
Note, that since the view of the adversary when run inside $\zdv$ is the same as its
view with access to the real random oracle, it produces exactly the same
output. After the first run, $\zdv$ outputs the index $i$ of a random oracle query
that was used by $\bdv$ to compute the challenge
$\zkproof[k''].\ch = \ro(\zkproof_{\advse}[0..k''])$ it had to answer in the $(k'' + 1)$-th
round and adversary's transcript, denoted by $s_1$ in $\genforking$'s description. If
no such query took place $\zdv$ outputs $i = 0$.
		
Then, new random oracle responses are picked for queries indexed by $i, \ldots, q$
and the adversary is rewound to the point just prior to when it gets the response to
RO query $\zkproof_{\advse}[0..k'']$. The adversary gets a random oracle response from
a new set of responses $h^2_i, \ldots, h^2_q$. If the adversary requests a simulated
proof after seeing $h^2_i$, then $\zdv$ computes the simulated proof on its
own. Eventually, $\zdv$ outputs index $i'$ of a query that was used by the adversary
to compute $\ro(\zkproof_{\advse}[0..k''])$, and a new transcript $s_2$. $\zdv$ is run
$n$ times with different random oracle responses.  Eventually, if all runs of $\zdv$
were successful, then tree of acceptable transcripts $\tree$ is built.
  % If a tree
  % $\tree$ of $n$ transcripts is built, then $\ext$ internally runs the tree extractor
  % $\extt(\tree)$ and outputs what it returns.
		
We emphasize here the importance of the unique response property. If it does not hold
then in some $j$-th execution of $\zdv$ the adversary $\adv$ (run internally in
$\bdv$) could reuse a challenge that it learned from observing proofs in $Q$. In that
case, $\bdv$ would output a proof that would make $\zdv$ output $i = 0$, making the
extractor fail. Fortunately, the case that the adversary breaks the unique response
property has already been covered by the abort condition in $\game{1}$.
		
Denote by $\waccProb$ the probability that $\advse$ outputs a proof that is accepted
and does not break $\ur{k}$-ness of $\ps$. With the same probability, an accepting
proof is returned by $\bdv$. This comes since the proof system is
$k'$-programmable. That is, $\bdv$ when providing $\adv$ with simulated proofs
programs the random oracle only in rounds from $k'$ on or, to put that differently,
it does not program the random oracle for rounds $1$ to $k' - 1$.  Hence, $\adv$
outputs proof that does not contain any programmed random oracle output and $\bdv$
can output that proof as its own. This holds since (1) for rounds $1$ to $k' - 1$,
the simulator does not program the oracle, (2) $\adv$ cannot use a part of a
simulated proof in rounds $k'$ to $\mu$ because of the unique response property.
	
	\ncase{Game 1 to Game 2}
		Note that for every accepting proof $\zkproof_{\advse}$, we may
		assume that whenever $\advse$ outputs a round $k''$ message $\zkproof_{\advse}[k'']$, then the
		$(\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}[1..k''])$ random oracle query was made by the adversary, not
		the simulator\footnote{\cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12} calls these queries \emph{fresh}.}, i.e.~there
		is no simulated proof $\zkproof_\simulator$ on $\inp_\simulator$ such that
		$(\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse} [1..k'']) = (\inp_\simulator,
		\zkproof_\simulator[1..k''])$. Otherwise, the game would be already interrupted by the error
		event in Game $\game{1}$.  As previously,
		\( \abs{\prob{\game{1}} - \prob{\game{2}}} \leq \prob{\event{\errfrk}}\,.  \)
		

    Denote by $\waccProb'$ the probability that algorithm $\zdv$, defined in the general forking lemma,
		produces an accepting proof with a fresh challenge after round $k''$. From the above argument,
		we have that $\waccProb = \waccProb'$.
		
		Next, from the generalised forking lemma, cf.~\cref{lem:generalised_forking_lemma}, we get that
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
		\prob{\event{\errfrk}} \leq 1 - \waccProb \cdot \left(\infrac{\waccProb^{n -
				1}}{q^{n - 1}} + \infrac{(2^\secpar) !}{((2^\secpar - n)! \cdot
			(2^\secpar)^{n})} - 1\right).
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
	
	\ngame{3}
    This game is identical to $\game{2}$ except that the extractor $\ext$, given tree
    of acceptable transcripts $\tree$ runs additionally $\extt (\tree)$ to learn the
    witness $\wit$. The environment additionally aborts this game if $\REL(\inp,
    \wit)$ does not hold.
	
	\ncase{Game 2 to Game 3}	
		Since $\ps$ is forking-sound the probability that $\extt(\tree)$
		fails is upper-bounded by $\epsss(\secpar)$.
		
		Since Game $\game{3}$ is aborted when it is impossible to extract a witness from
		$\tree$ and $\bdv$ only passes proofs produced by $\adv$, the adversary $\advse$ cannot
		win. Thus, by the game-hopping argument,
		\[
		\abs{\prob{\game{0}} - \prob{\game{4}}} \leq 1 -
		\left(\frac{\waccProb^{n}}{q^{n - 1}} + \waccProb \cdot \frac{(2^\secpar)
			!}{(2^\secpar - n)! \cdot (2^\secpar)^{n}} - \waccProb\right) + \epsur(\secpar) +
		%q_{\ro}^{\mu} \epss +
		\epsss(\secpar)\,.
		\]
		Thus the probability that extractor $\extss$ succeeds is at least
		\[
		\frac{\waccProb^{n}}{q^{n - 1}} + \waccProb \cdot \frac{(2^\secpar)
			!}{(2^\secpar - n)! \cdot (2^\secpar)^{n}} - \waccProb - \epsur(\secpar) 
		%- q_{\ro}^{\mu} \epss
		- \epsss(\secpar)\,.
		\]
		Since $\waccProb$ is the probability of $\advse$ producing an accepting transcript
		that does not break $\ur{k}$-ness of $\ps$, then $\waccProb \geq \accProb -
		\epsur(\secpar)$, where $\accProb$ is the probability of $\advse$ outputting an accepting
		proof as defined in \cref{def:updsimext}. Thus, 
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:frk}
		\extProb \geq \frac{(\accProb - \epsur(\secpar))^{n}}{q^{n - 1}} -
		\underbrace{(\accProb - \epsur(\secpar)) \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{(2^\secpar)
				!}{(2^\secpar - n)! \cdot (2^\secpar)^{n}}\right) - \epsur(\secpar) -
			% q_{\ro}^{\mu} \epss -
			\epsss(\secpar)}_{\eps(\secpar)}\,.
		\end{equation}
		Note that the part of \cref{eq:frk} denoted by $\eps(\secpar)$ is negligible as
		$\epsur(\secpar), \epsss(\secpar)$ are negligible, and
		$\frac{(2^\secpar) !}{(2^\secpar - n)! \cdot (2^\secpar)^{n}} \geq
		\left(\infrac{(2^\secpar - n)}{2^\secpar}\right)^{n}$ is overwhelming.  Therefore,
		\[
		\extProb \geq q^{-(n - 1)} (\accProb - \epsur(\secpar))^{n} -\eps(\secpar)\,.
		\] 
		and $\psfs$ is \COMMENT{forking }simulation extractable with extraction error $\epsur(\secpar)$.
	\qed
\end{proof}


We conjecture that based on the recent results on state restoration
soundness~\cite{C:GhoTes21}, which effectively allows to query the verifier multiple
times on different overlapping transcripts, the $q^{\mu}$ loss could be
avoided. However, this would reduce the class of protocols covered by our results.
