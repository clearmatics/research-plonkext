\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
\subsection{Notations} Let $\ppt$ denote probabilistic polynomial-time and $\secpar \in \NN$ be the
security parameter. All adversaries are stateful. For an algorithm $\adv$, let
$\image (\adv)$ be the image of $\adv$ (the set of valid outputs of $\adv$), let
$\RND{\adv}$ denote the set of random tapes of correct length for $\adv$
(assuming the given value of $\secpar$), and let $r \sample \RND{\adv}$ denote
the random choice of the randomiser $r$ from $\RND{\adv}$. We denote by $\negl$
($\poly$) an arbitrary negligible (resp.~polynomial) function.

Probability ensembles $X = \smallset{X_\secpar}_\secpar$ and $Y =
\smallset{Y_\secpar}_\secpar$, for distributions $X_\secpar, Y_\secpar$, have
\emph{statistical distance} $\SD$ equal $\epsilon(\secpar)$ if $\sum_{a \in
  \supp{X_\secpar \cup Y_\secpar}} \abs{\prob{X_\secpar = a} - \prob{Y_\secpar =
    a}} = \epsilon(\secpar)$. We write $X \approx_\secpar Y$ if $\SD(X_\secpar,
Y_\secpar) \leq \negl$. For values $a(\secpar)$ and $b(\secpar)$ we write
$a(\secpar) \approx_\secpar b(\secpar)$ if $\abs{a(\secpar) - b(\secpar)} \leq
\negl$.

For a probability space $(\samplespace, \eventspace, \probfunction)$ and event
$\event{E} \in \eventspace$ we denote by $\nevent{E}$ an event that is
complementary to $\event{E}$,
i.e.~$\nevent{E} = \samplespace \setminus \event{E}$.

Denote by $\RELGEN = \smallset{\REL}$ a family of relations. We assume that if
$\REL$ comes with any auxiliary input, the later is benign. Directly from the
description of $\REL$ one learns security parameter $\secpar$ and description of the
group $\GRP$, if the relation is a relation of group elements (as it usually is
in case of zkSNARKs).

\ourpar{Bilinear groups.}
A bilinear group generator $\pgen (\secparam)$ returns public parameters $ \pp =
(p, \GRP_1, \GRP_2, \GRP_T, \pair, \gone{1}, \gtwo{1})$, where $\GRP_1$,
$\GRP_2$, and $\GRP_T$ are additive cyclic groups of prime order $p = 2^{\Omega
  (\secpar)}$, $\gone{1}, \gtwo{1}$ are generators of $\GRP_1$, $\GRP_2$, resp.,
and $\pair: \GRP_1 \times \GRP_2 \to \GRP_T$ is a non-degenerate
$\ppt$-computable bilinear pairing. We assume the bilinear pairing to be Type-3,
i.e., that there is no efficient isomorphism from $\GRP_1$ to $\GRP_2$ or from
$\GRP_2$ to $\GRP_1$. We use the by now standard bracket notation, i.e., we
write $\bmap{a}{\gi}$ to denote $a g_{\gi}$ where $g_{\gi}$ is a fixed generator
of $\GRP_{\gi}$. We denote $\pair (\gone{a}, \gtwo{b})$ as $\gone{a} \bullet
\gtwo{b}$. Thus, $\gone{a} \bullet \gtwo{b} = \gtar{a b}$. We freely use the
bracket notation with matrices, e.g., if $\vec{A} \vec{B} = \vec{C}$ then
$\vec{A} \grpgi{\vec{B}} = \grpgi{\vec{C}}$ and $\gone{\vec{A}}\bullet
\gtwo{\vec{B}} = \gtar{\vec{C}}$. Since every algorithm $\adv$ takes as input
the public parameters we skip them when describing $\adv$'s input. Similarly, we
do not explicitly state that each protocol starts with generating these
parameters by $\pgen$.

\begin{lemma}[Difference lemma,~{\cite[Lemma 1]{EPRINT:Shoup04}}]
	\label{lem:difference_lemma}
	Let $\event{A}, \event{B}, \event{F}$ be events defined in some probability
	space, and suppose that $\event{A} \land \nevent{F} \iff \event{B}
		\land \nevent{F}$.  Then 
	$
		\abs{\prob{\event{A}} - \prob{\event{B}}} \leq \prob{\event{F}}\,.
	$
\end{lemma}
\subsection{Algebraic Group Model}
The algebraic group model (AGM) introduced in \cite{C:FucKilLos18} lies between
the standard model and generic bilinear group model. In the AGM it is assumed
that an adversary $\adv$ can output a group element $\gnone{y} \in \GRP$ if
$\gnone{y}$ has been computed by applying group operations to group elements
given to $\adv$ as input. It is further assumed, that $\adv$ knows how to
``build'' $\gnone{y}$ from that elements. More precisely, the AGM requires that
whenever $\adv(\gnone{\vec{x}})$ outputs a group element $\gnone{y}$ then it
also outputs $\vec{c}$ such that $\gnone{y} = \vec{c}^\top \cdot
\gnone{\vec{x}}$. Both $\plonk$ and $\sonic$ have been shown secure using the
AGM. An adversary that works in the AGM is called \emph{algebraic}.

\subsection{Polynomial commitment}
\label{sec:poly_com}
In the polynomial commitment scheme $\PCOM = (\kgen, \com, \open, \verify)$ the
committer $\committer$ can convince the receiver $\receiver$ that some
polynomial $\p{f}$ which $\committer$ committed to evaluates to $s$ at some
point $z$ chosen by $\receiver$. $\PCOM$'s subroutines are defined as follows 
\begin{description}
\item[$\kgen(1^\secpar, \maxdeg)$:] The key generation algorithm
  $\kgen(1^\secpar, \maxdeg)$ takes in a security parameter $1^\secpar$ and a
  parameter $\maxdeg$ which determines the maximal degree of the committed
  polynomial. It outputs a structured reference string $\srs$ (including a
  commitment key).
\item[$\com(\srs, \p{f})$:] The commitment algorithm $\com(\srs, \p{f})$ takes
  in $\srs$ and a polynomial $\p{f}$ with maximum degree $\maxdeg$, and outputs
  a commitment $c$.
\item[$\open(\srs, z, s, \p{f})$:] The opening algorithm
  $\open(\srs, z, s, \p{f})$ takes as input $\srs$, an evaluation point $z$, a
  value $s$ and the polynomial $\p{f}$. It outputs an opening $o$.
\item[$\verify(\srs, c, z, s, o)$:] The verification algorithm takes in $\srs$,
  a commitment $c$, an evaluation point $z$, a value $s$ and an opening $o$. It
  outputs 1 if $o$ is a valid opening for $(c, z, s)$ and 0 otherwise.
\end{description}

$\plonk$ and $\sonic$ use variants of the KZG polynomial commitment scheme
\cite{AC:KatZavGol10}. We denote the first by $\PCOMp$ and the latter by
$\PCOMs$. Due to page limit, we omit their presentation here and refer to
\cref{fig:pcomp} and \cref{fig:pcoms} in the \cref{sec:pcom}.  In this paper we
use evaluation binding, commitment of knowledge, and, newly introduced, unique
opening and hiding properties. Formal definitions of these could be find in
\cref{sec:pcom}, here we briefly introduce them.
\begin{compactdesc}
  \item[Evaluation binding] intuitively, this property assures that no adversary
    could provide two valid openings for two different evaluations of the same
    commitment in the same point. 
  \item[Commitment of knowledge] when a commitment scheme is ``of
    knowledge'' then if an adversary produces a (valid) commitment $c$, which it
    can open, then it also knows the underlying polynomial $\p{f}$ which commits
    to that value.  \cite{CCS:MBKM19} shows, using AGM, that $\PCOMs$ is a
    commitment of knowledge.  The same reasoning could be used to show that
    property for $\PCOMp$.
  \item[Unique opening] this property assures that there is
    only one valid opening for the committed polynomial and given evaluation
    point. This property is crucial in showing forking simulation-extractability
    of $\plonk$ and $\sonic$. We show that the $\plonk$'s and $\sonic$'s
    polynomial commitment schemes satisfy this requirement in
    \cref{lem:pcomp_op} and \cref{lem:pcoms_unique_op} respectively.
  \item[Hiding] assures that no adversary is able to tell anything about the
    polynomial given only its commitment and bounded number of evaluations.
\end{compactdesc}


\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems}
Let $\RELGEN(\secparam) = \smallset{\REL}$ be a family of
$\npol$ relations. Denote by $\LANG_\REL$ the language determined by $\REL$.
Let $\prover$ be a \emph{prover} and $\verifier$ be the \emph{verifier}, both $\ppt$ algorithms. We allow our proof system to have
a setup, i.e.~there is a $\kgen$ algorithm that takes as input the relation
description $\REL$ and outputs a common reference string $\srs$. We assume that
the $\srs$ defines the relation and for universal prove systems, such as Plonk
and Sonic, we treat both the reference string and the relation as universal.

We denote by $\ip{\prover(\srs, \inp, \wit)}{\verifier(\srs,\inp)}$ a
\emph{transcript} (also called \emph{proof}) $\zkproof$ of a conversation
between $\prover$ with input $(\srs, \inp, \wit)$ and $\verifier$ with input
$(\srs, \inp)$. We write
$\ip{\prover (\srs, \inp, \wit)}{\verifier(\srs, \inp)} = 1$ if in the end of
the transcript the verifier $\verifier$ returns $1$ and say that $\verifier$
accepts it.  For non-interactive proof systems we abuse notation and write
$\verifier(\srs, \inp, \zkproof) = 1$ to denote a fact that $\zkproof$ is
accepted by the verifier.  

A proof system $\proofsystem = (\kgen, \prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ for
$\RELGEN$ is required to have three properties: completeness, soundness and zero
knowledge, which are defined as follows:
% \begin{description}

\ourpar{Completeness.}
%\item[Completeness]
  An interactive proof system $\proofsystem$ is
  \emph{complete} if an honest prover always convinces an honest verifier, that
  is for all $\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$ and $(\inp, \wit) \in \REL$
	\[
		\condprob{\ip{\prover (\srs, \inp, \wit)}{\verifier (\srs,
        \inp)} = 1}{\srs \gets \kgen(\REL)} = 1\,.
	\]
    % \item[Soundness]
\ourpar{Soundness.}
    We say that $\proofsystem$ for $\RELGEN$ is \emph{sound} if no
  $\ppt$ prover $\adv$ can convince an honest verifier $\verifier$ to accept a
  proof for a false statement $\inp \not\in\LANG$. More precisely, for
  all $\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$
	\[
    \condprob{\ip{\adv(\srs, \inp)}{\verifier(\srs, \inp)} = 1 \land \inp
      \not\in \LANG_\REL}{\srs \gets \kgen(\REL), \inp \gets \adv(\srs)} \leq
    \negl\,;
	\]
%\end{description}
Sometimes a stronger notion of soundness is required---except requiring that the
verifier rejects proofs of statements outside the language, we request from the
prover to know a witness corresponding to the proven statement. This property is
called \emph{knowledge soundness}.%\markulf{Commented out the formal definition as we don't use it.}
 
\ourpar{Zero knowledge.}  We call a proof system $\proofsystem$
\emph{zero-knowledge} if for any $\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$, and adversary
$\adv$ there exists a $\ppt$ simulator $\simulator$ such that for any
$(\inp, \wit) \in \REL$
\begin{multline*}
	  \left\{\ip{\prover(\srs, \inp, \wit)}{\adv(\srs, \inp, \wit)}
      \,\left|\, \srs \gets \kgen(\REL)\COMMENT{, (\inp, \wit) \gets \adv(\REL,
          \srs)}\vphantom{\simulator^\adv}\right.\right\} \approx_\secpar
		%\\
		\left\{\simulator^{\adv}(\srs, \inp)\,\left|\, \srs \gets
        \kgen(\REL)\COMMENT{, (\inp, \wit) \gets \adv(\REL,
          \srs)}\vphantom{\simulator^\adv}\right.\right\}\,.
\end{multline*}
	%
We call zero knowledge \emph{perfect} if the distributions are equal and
\emph{computational} if they are indistinguishable for any $\ppt$ distinguisher.

% \end{description}
Alternatively, zero-knowledge can be defined by allowing the simulator to use
the trapdoor $\td$ that is generated along the $\srs$. In this paper we distinguish
simulators that requires a trapdoor to simulate and those that do not. We call
the former \emph{SRS-simulators}. We say that a protocol is zero knowledge in
the standard model if its simulator does not require the trapdoor.

% Occasionally, a weaker version of zero knowledge is sufficient. So called
% \emph{honest verifier zero knowledge} (HVZK) assumes that the verifier's
% challenges are picked at random from some predefined set. Although weaker, this
% definition suffices in many applications. Especially, an interactive
% zero-knowledge proof that is HVZK and \emph{public-coin} (i.e.~the verifier
% outputs as challenges its random coins) can be made non-interactive and
% zero-knowledge in the random oracle model by using the Fiat--Shamir
% transformation.

In security reductions in this paper it is sometimes needed to produce
simulated NIZK proofs without knowning the trapdoor, just by
programming the random oracle. We call protocols which allow for such kind of
simulation \emph{trapdoor-less simulatable} (TLS). More precisely,

\begin{definition}[Trapdoor-less simulatable proof system]
  Let $\ps = (\kgen, \prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ be a NIZK proof
  system and $\ro$ a random oracle. Let $\simulator$ be a pair of
  algorithms: $\simulator_\ro$ that takes random oracle queries and
  answers them, $\simulator_\prover$ that takes as input an SRS $\srs$
  and instance $\inp$ and outputs a proof $\zkproof_\simulator$.  We
  call $\ps$ \emph{trapdoor-less simulatable} if for any adversary
  $\adv$, $\eps_0 \approx \eps_1$, where
  \begin{align}
    \eps_b = \Pr\left[
    \begin{aligned}
      \adv^{\oracleo_b}(\srs) = 0
    \end{aligned}
    \, \left| \,
    \begin{aligned}
      \srs \sample \kgen(\secpar)
    \end{aligned}
    \right.\right]
  \end{align}
  where $\oracleo_b$ takes two types of adversary's queries:
  \begin{description}
  \item[random oracle calls:] on $\adv$'s query $x$, $\oracleo_b$
    responds with $\ro(x)$ if $b = 0$, and with $y \gets
    \simulator_\ro(\srs, x)$, if $b = 1$.
  \item[proof calls:] on $\adv$'s query $\inp, \wit$ responds
  with a real proof $\zkproof_\prover \gets
  \prover(\srs, \inp, \wit)$ if $b = 0$ or a simulated proof $\zkproof_\simulator \gets \simulator (\srs,
  \inp)$ if $b = 1$. 
  \end{description} 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[TLS vs HVZK]
  We note that TLS notion is closely related to honest-verifier zero knowledge in the standard model. That is, if we consider an interactive proof system $\proofsystem$ that is HVZK in the standard model then its Fiat--Shamir compiled version $\proofsystem_\fs$ is TLS. This comes as the simulator $\simulator$ in $\proofsystem$ produces a valid simulated proof by picking verifier's challenges according to a predefined distribution and $\proofsystem_\fs$'s simulator $\simulator_\fs$ produces its proofs similarly by picking the challenges and additionally programming the random oracle to return the picked challenges. Importantly, in both $\proofsystem$ and $\proofsystem_\fs$ success of the simulator does not depend on access to an SRS trapdoor (which may not even exists if the proof systems are transparent).
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[$k$-programmable ZK]
  \label{def:kzk}
  Let $\ps$ be a $(2\mu + 1)$-message ZK proof system and let $\ps_\fs$ be its
  Fiat--Shamir variant. We say that $\ps_\fs$ is $k$-programmable ZK if there
  exists a simulator $\simulator_\fs$ that
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item produces proofs indistinguishable from proofs output by an honest
    prover;
  \item $\simulator_\fs$ programs the random oracle \emph{only} for
    challenges from round $k$ to $\mu + 1$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{definition}
We note that $\plonk$ is $2$-programmable ZK, $\sonic$ is $1$-programmable ZK,
and $\marlin$ is $1$-programmable ZK. This follows directly from the proofs of
their standard model zero-knowledge property in
\cref{lem:plonk_hvzk,lem:sonic_hvzk,lem:marlin_hvzk}. 

\oursubsub{Idealised verifier and verification equations} Let
$(\kgen, \prover, \verifier)$ be a proof system.
% or a polynomial commitment
% scheme\hamid{might be unclear as we are defining polynomial commitments as
%   $(\kgen, \com, \open, \verify)$.}.
Observe that the $\kgen$ algorithm provides an SRS which can be interpreted as a
set of group representation of polynomials evaluated at trapdoor
elements. E.g.~for a trapdoor $\chi$ the SRS contains
$\gone{\p{p_1}(\chi), \ldots, \p{p_k}(\chi)}$, for some polynomials
$\p{p_1}(X), \ldots, \p{p_k}(X) \in \FF_p[X]$. On the other hand, the verifier
$\verifier$ accepts if a (possibly set of) verification equation
$\vereq_{\inp, \zkproof}$ (note that the verification equation changes relate to
the instance $\inp$ and proof $\zkproof$), which can also be interpreted as a
polynomial in $\FF_p[X]$ whose coefficients depend on messages sent by the
prover, zeroes at $\chi$. Following \cite{EPRINT:GabWilCio19} we call verifiers
who checks that $\vereq_{\inp, \zkproof}(\chi) = 0$ \emph{real verifiers} as
opposed to \emph{ideal verifiers} who accepts only when
$\vereq_{\inp, \zkproof}(X) = 0$. That is, while a real verifier accepts when a
polynomial \emph{evaluates} to zero, an ideal verifier accepts only when the
polynomial \emph{is} zero.

Although ideal verifiers are impractical, they are very useful in our
proofs. More precisely, we show that
\begin{compactenum}
\item the idealised verifier accepts an incorrect proof (what ``incorrect''
  means depends on the situation) with at most negligible probability (and many
  cases---never);
\item when the real verifier accepts, but not the idealised one, then we show
  how to use a malicious $\prover$ to break the underlying security assumption
  (in our case---a variant of $\dlog$.)
\end{compactenum}

Analogously, idealised verifier can also be defined for polynomial commitment scheme.

\oursubsub{Sigma protocols}
A sigma protocol $\sigmaprot = (\prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ for a relation
$\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$ is a special case of an interactive proof where a
transcript consists of three messages $(a, b, z)$, where $b$ is a challenge
provided by the verifier. Sigma protocols are honest verifier zero-knowledge in
the standard model and specially-sound. That is, there exists an extractor
$\ext$ which given two accepting transcripts $(a, b, z)$, $(a, b', z')$ for a
statement $\inp$ can recreate the corresponding witness if $b \neq b'$.
More formally:
% \begin{description}

\ourpar{Special soundness.}
% \hamid{The last (short) sentence looks a little unclear.}
A sigma protocol $\sigmaprot$ is \emph{specially-sound}
  if for any adversary $\adv$ the probability
\[
\Pr\left[
\begin{aligned}
& \verifier(\REL, \inp, (a, b, z)) = %\\
\verifier(\REL, \inp, (a, b', z')) = 1 \\
& \land b \neq b' \land \REL(\inp, \wit) = 0 \\
\end{aligned}
\,\left|\,
\begin{aligned}
& (\inp, (a, b, z), (a, b', z')) \gets \adv(\REL), \\ %\\
& \wit \gets \ext(\REL, \inp, (a, b, z), (a, b', z'))\\
\end{aligned}
\right.\right]
\]
is upper-bounded by some negligible function $\negl$.
%\end{description}

Another property that sigma protocols may have is a unique response
property \cite{C:Fischlin05} which states that no $\ppt$ adversary can
produce two accepting transcripts that differ only on the last
element. More precisely, 
%\begin{description} 
\ourpar{Unique response property.} Let
$\sigmaprot = (\prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ be a sigma-protocol for
$\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$ with proofs of the form
$(a, b, z)$. We say that $\sigmaprot$ has the unique response property if for
all $\ppt$ algorithms $\adv$, it holds that,:
\[ \condprob{\verifier (\REL, \inp, (a, b, z)) = \verifier (\REL, \inp, (a, b,
	z')) = 1 \land z \neq z'}{(\inp, a, b, z, z') \gets \adv(\REL)} \leq \negl\,.  \]
%\end{description} 
If this property holds even against unbounded adversaries, it is called
\emph{strict}, cf.~\cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12}. Later on we call protocols that
follows this notion \emph{ur-protocols}. For the sake of completeness we note
that many sigma protocols, like e.g.~Schnorr's protocol \cite{C:Schnorr89},
fulfil this property.

\subsection{From interactive to non-interactive---the Fiat--Shamir transform}
Consider a $(2\mu + 1)$-message, public-coin, honest verifier zero-knowledge
interactive proof system
$\proofsystem = (\kgen, \prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ for
$\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$.  Let $\zkproof$ be a proof performed by the
prover $\prover$ and verifier $\verifier$ compound of messages
$(a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_{\mu}, b_{\mu}, a_{\mu + 1})$, where $a_i$ comes from
$\prover$ and $b_i$ comes from $\verifier$.  Denote by $\ro$ a random oracle.
Let $\proofsystem_\fs = (\kgen_\fs, \prover_\fs, \verifier_\fs, \simulator_\fs)$
be a proof system such that
\begin{compactitem}
  \item $\kgen_\fs$ behaves as $\kgen$.
  \item $\prover_\fs$ behaves as $\prover$ except after sending message
    $a_i$, $i \in \range{1}{\mu}$, the prover does not wait for
    the message from the verifier but computes it locally setting $b_i
    = \ro(\zkproof[0..i])$, where $\zkproof[0..j] = (\inp, a_1, b_1, \ldots,
    a_{j - 1}, b_{j - 1}, a_j)$. (Importantly, $\zkproof[0..\mu + 1] =
    (\inp, \zkproof)$).
  \item $\verifier_\fs$ behaves as $\verifier$ but does not provide
    challenges to the prover's proof. Instead it computes the
    challenges locally as $\prover_\fs$ does. Then it verifies the
    resulting transcript $\zkproof$ as the verifier $\verifier$ would. 
  \item $\simulator_\fs$ behaves as $\simulator$, except when
    $\simulator$ picks challenge $b_i$ before computing message $\zkproof[0, i]$, $\simulator_\fs$ programs the
    random oracle to output $b_i$ on $\zkproof[0, i]$.
  \end{compactitem}

\noindent
The Fiat--Shamir heuristic states that $\proofsystem_\fs$ is a zero-knowledge
non-interactive proof system for $\REL \in \RELGEN(\secparam)$.

%\subsection{Non-malleability definitions for NIZKs}
%\label{sec:simext_def}
%Real life applications often require a NIZK proof system to be
%non-malleable. That is, no adversary seeing a proof $\zkproof$ for a statement
%$\inp$ should be able to provide a new proof $\zkproof'$ related to $\zkproof$.
%\emph{Simulation extractability} formalizes a strong version of non-malleability
%by requiring that no adversary can produce a valid proof without knowing the
%corresponding witness. This must hold even if the adversary is allowed to see
%polynomially many simulated proofs for any statements it wishes.
%
%%\chaya{remove reference to forking soundness. quantify for $\ext_\se$}
%\begin{definition}[Forking simulation-extractable NIZK, \cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12}]
%	\label{def:simext}
%  Let $\ps_\fs = (\kgen_\fs, \prover_\fs, \verifier_\fs, \simulator_\fs)$ be a
%  HVZK proof system\hamid{$\ps_\fs$ is the Fiat-Shamir variant of the underlying proof system. So maybe we mean the underlying proof system is HVZK?}. We say that $\ps_\fs$ is \emph{forking
%    simulation-extractable} with \emph{extraction error} $\nu$ if for any $\ppt$
%  adversary $\adv$ that is given oracle access to a random oracle $\ro$ and
%  simulator $\simulator_\fs$, and produces an accepting transcript of $\ps$ with
%  probability $\accProb$, where
%	\[
%		\accProb = \Pr \left[
%		\begin{aligned}

%	\]
%	is at at least 
%	\[
%		\extProb \geq \frac{1}{\poly} (\accProb - \nu)^d - \eps(\secpar)\,,
%	\]
%	for some polynomial $\poly$, constant $d$ and negligible $\eps(\secpar)$ whenever
%  $\accProb \geq \nu$. List $Q$ contains all $(\inp, \zkproof)$ pairs where
%  $\inp$ is an instance provided to the simulator by the adversary and
%  $\zkproof$ is the simulator's answer. List $Q_\ro$ contains all $\advse$'s
%  queries to $\ro$ and $\ro$'s answers.
%\end{definition}


\subsection{Updatable SRS schemes}
We recall the definition of an updatable SRS scheme from~\cite{C:GKMMM18} which consists of the following algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	$(\srs,\rho) \leftarrow \kgen(\secparam)$ is a PPT algorithm that takes a security parameter $\secpar$ and outputs a SRS $\srs$, and correctness proof $\rho$.
	\item
	$ (\srs',\rho') \leftarrow \upd(1^\secpar,\srs,\{\rho_i \}_{i=1}^n)$ is a PPT algorithm that takes as input the security parameter $\secpar$, a SRS $\srs$, a list of update proofs and outputs an updated SRS together with a proof of correct update. 
	\item
	$b \leftarrow \verifyCRS(1^\secpar,\srs,\{\rho_i \}_{i=1}^n)$ is a DPT algorithm that takes the security parameter $\secpar$, a SRS $\srs$, a list of update proofs, and outputs a bit indicating acceptance or not.
\end{itemize}

In the next section, we define security notions in the updatable setting. To this end, we define an SRS update oracle $\initU$ in~\cref{fig:upd} by which the adversary updates the SRS. We also define the simulation oracle $\simO$ in~\cref{fig:upd} that is the simulator w.r.t. the SRS finalised by the adversary using $\initU$. This simulation oracle will be used in the definition of forking simulation extractability.

% Consider a sigma protocol $\sigmaprot = (\prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ that
% is special-sound and has a unique response property. Let $\sigmaprot_\fs =
% (\prover_\fs, \verifier_\fs, \simulator_\fs)$ be a NIZK obtained by applying the
% Fiat--Shamir transform to $\sigmaprot$. Faust et al.~\cite{INDOCRYPT:FKMV12}
% show that every such $\sigmaprot_\fs$ is forking simulation-extractable. This result is
% presented in \cref{sec:forking_lemma} along with the instrumental forking lemma,
% cf.~\cite{CCS:BelNev06}.

\noindent \textbf{Simulation sound NIZKs.}
Another notion for non-malleable NIZKs is \emph{simulation soundness}. It allows the adversary to see simulated proof, however, in contrast to simulation
extractability it does not require an extractor to provide a witness for the
proven statement. Instead, it is only necessary, that an adversary who sees
simulated proofs cannot make the verifier accept a proof of an incorrect
statement. More precisely,
\chaya{this definition will go}
\begin{definition}[Simulation soundness]
  	\label{def:simsnd}
    Let $\ps = (\kgen, \prover, \verifier, \simulator)$ be a NIZK proof and
    $\ps_\fs = (\kgen_\fs, \prover_\fs, \verifier_\fs, \simulator_\fs)$ be $\ps$
    transformed by the Fiat--Shamir transform. We say that $\ps_\fs$ is
    \emph{simulation-sound}
    for any $\ppt$ adversary $\adv$ that is given oracle access to a random
    oracle $\ro$ and simulator $\simulator_\fs$, probability
    \[
      \ssndProb =
      \Pr\left[
        \begin{aligned}
          & \verifier_\fs(\srs, \inp_{\adv}, \zkproof_{\adv}) = 1,\\
          & (\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}) \not\in Q,\\
          & \neg \exists \wit_{\adv}: \REL(\inp_{\adv}, \wit_{\adv}) = 1
        \end{aligned}
        \, \left| \,
          \vphantom{\begin{aligned}
          & \verifier_\fs(\srs, \inp_{\adv}, \zkproof_{\adv}) = 1,\\
          & (\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}) \not\in Q,\\
          & \neg \exists \wit_{\adv}: \REL(\inp_{\adv}, \wit_{\adv}) = 1
        \end{aligned}}
      \begin{aligned}
        & \srs \gets \kgen(\REL), r \sample \RND{\advse},\\
        & (\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}) \gets \advse^{\simulator_\fs,
          \ro} (\srs; r)
      \end{aligned}
		\right.  \right]
    \]
    is at most negligible.  List $Q$ contains all $(\inp, \zkproof)$ pairs where
  $\inp$ is an instance provided to the simulator by the adversary and
  $\zkproof$ is the simulator's answer. 
\end{definition}

  \label{rem:simext_to_simsnd}
  We note that the probability $\ssndProb$ \cref{def:simsnd} can be expressed in
  terms of simulation-extractability. More precisely, the
  condition $\neg \exists \wit: \REL(\inp_\adv, \wit_\adv) = 1$ can be substituted with
  $\REL(\inp_\adv, \wit_\adv) = 0$, where $\wit_\adv$, returned by a possibly unbounded
  extractor, is either a witness to $\inp_\adv$ (if there exists any) or $\bot$ (if
  there is none). More precisely,
\[
      \ssndProb =
      \Pr\left[
        \begin{aligned}
          & \verifier_\fs(\srs, \inp_{\adv}, \zkproof_{\adv}) = 1,\\
          & (\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}) \not\in Q,\\
          & \REL(\inp_{\adv}, \wit_{\adv}) = 0
        \end{aligned}
        \, \left| \,
      \begin{aligned}
        & \srs \gets \kgen(\REL), r \sample \RND{\advse},\\
        & (\inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse}) \gets \advse^{\simulator_\fs,
          \ro} (\srs; r)\\
        & \wit_{\adv} \gets \ext(\srs, \advse, r, \inp_{\advse}, \zkproof_{\advse},
			Q, Q_\ro,) 
      \end{aligned}
		\right.  \right].
\]
The only necessary input to the unbounded extractor $\ext$ is the instance
$\inp_\adv$ (the rest is given for the consistency with the simulation extractability
definition). 
%
With the probabilities in \cref{def:simext} holding regardless of whether the extractor
is unbounded or not, we obtain the following equality
$ \ssndProb = \accProb - \extProb$.

% In \cref{cor:simext_to_ssnd} we show that (under some mild conditions) this is enough
% to conjecture that probability $\ssndProb$ is not only at most negligible, but
% also, in some parameters, exponentially smaller than $(1 - \extProb)$
% (probability of extraction failure in \cref{def:simext}).
