We thank the reviewers for their comments, unfortunately, due to space limit we
are able to answer only to some of them. 
Regarding required number of rewinding for Plonk (3n + 1) we note that although
this number is linear it does not contradict succinctness as extractor may work
in time greater than sublinear w.r.t the circuit size. The only reason why the
extractor is inefficient comes from the bounds introduced by our generalized
forking lemma, however, a recent paper by Attmea, Fehr and Kloo√ü "Fiat-Shamir
Transformation of Multi-Round Interactive Proofs" shows that these bounds can be
make much tighter, namely, the extractor succeeds with an overwhelming
probability working in expected time roughly Q^r where Q is the number of random
oracle calls the adversary makes and r is the number of rounds in the protocol.
