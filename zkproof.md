# Simulation extractability of zkSNARKs

## Motivation
More realistic adversarial model

SNARKy signatures out of the box

## Required properties
### unique-response property
After $k$ rounds the prover sends messages that are determined by the previously sent 
### trapdoor-less zero knowledge
### forking soundness
